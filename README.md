## 📊 My process

I started with the HTML document, creating the page (main), then inserting the divisions, my balance with titles and empty span and staticks with empty span and titles, lower down I defined a border to make the separation, after the separation there are more empty spans and titles.

### 🏗️ Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Responsivess


### 📖What I learned

I learned how to better use forEach and for, as well as indexes.
